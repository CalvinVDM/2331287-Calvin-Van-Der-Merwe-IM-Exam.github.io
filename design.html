    <h2>OLD Style guide</h2>

    <p>
      For this website i decided to use a space theme as i thought it would be a
      cool theme to use through out the site i tried to incorporate all colors
      that would be seen in space but i decided to stick mostly with blue, black
      and white it was interesting process designing the site.

    <h2>New Style guide</h2>

    <p>
      looking back at the first webpage i realised that it just was not as good
      as it should of been in terms of design because of the fact that the
      webpage was themed very profusely around space. i decided to go for a more
      abstract theme this time and instead i chose the color red as my overall
      theme and main color to work around in the website. i had alot more fun
      this time around and realised how nice it is to cretae websites. in terms
      of UI and Ux not much has changes but i have tried to make evrything look
      cleaner and more clear to the people that access the page.
